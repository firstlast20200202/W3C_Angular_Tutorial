create an angular app:
$ ng new my-angular-app
and follow the prompts 

run the app:
cd my-angular-app
ng serve    //starts a local dev server and watches for changes
OR ng serve --open    //automatically open the app in your default browser, by default the dev server runs on http://localhost:4200

stop running the app:
ctrl+C

create a component:
$ ng generate component <component-name>

add toggleable tabs:
step 1, add HTML
step 2, add CSS
step 3, add JS

to make self defined component rendered:
1. put the functiion implementation in the index.html file 
(it shouldnt be in this file, it should be in app root component ts file; i copied the code from W3C html tutorial, here it mixes with angular, 
it would confuse the browser)

2. in index.html file:
<body>
  <app-self-defined></app-self-defined>    
</body>

3. in main.ts file:
import { SelfDefinedComponent } from './app/self-defined/self-defined.component';

idea:
have a add link showing a form
save the form will direct to another page
